Legend:

* Demo: vanilla Spring Boot MVC app with one endpoint
* Slim: same thing but explicitly `@Imports` all configuration
* Thin: reduce the `@Imports` down to a set of 4 that are needed for the endpoint
* Lite: copy the imports from "thin" and make them into hard-coded, unconditional configuration
* Func: extract the configuration methods from "lite" and register bits of it using the function bean API

N.B. The "thin" sample has `@EnableWebMvc` (implicitly), but "lite"
and "func" pulled the relevant features of that out into a separate
class (so a few beans were dropped).

|===
| sample | configs | beans

| demo | 32 | 108
| slim | 31 | 103
| thin | 14 | 60
| lite | 4  | 30
| func | 1  | 25
