This module provides a general purpose benchmark for any Spring Boot fat jar. You pass it the jar file to measure on the command line.

Example usage:

```
$ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar ~/dev/spring/spring-petclinic/target/spring-petclinic-2.0.0.jar
...
# Run complete. Total time: 00:02:44

Benchmark               Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units
MainBenchmark.fat       avgt   10  4.890 ± 0.055   s/op
MainBenchmark.launcher  avgt   10  4.976 ± 0.050   s/op
MainBenchmark.main      avgt   10  3.668 ± 0.095   s/op
```

For the "fat" benchmark is has to emit a log containing "started on port" by default when it is ready. You can change the "marker" that the benchmark looks for with --marker='Foo Bar' (for instance). Multiple values are acceptable, and any will terminate the measurement.

For the "main" (exploded jar with main class) and "launcher" (exploded jar with Boot launcher) benchmarks it also installs a listener that prints the number of classes loaded and the number of beans.

To pass arguments to JMH you need to put them after a single argument of `--`. E.g.

```
$ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar target/it/support/target/demo-1.0.0-exec.jar -- MainBenchmark.launcher
```
