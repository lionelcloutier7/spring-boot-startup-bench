# Changes to Spring Data Commons

Some observations were made from TRACE logging in the
petclinic. Instead of component scanning we could use
`spring.factories` for detecting "plugin" behaviour in Spring Data
Commons. These https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATACMNS-952[changes]
were made and the petclinic re-tested.

Before:

```
 PetclinicBenchmark.devtoolsRestart          avgt   10  1.387 ± 0.399   s/op
 PetclinicBenchmark.explodedJarMain          avgt   10  5.491 ± 0.357   s/op
 PetclinicBenchmark.fatJar                   avgt   10  6.130 ± 0.271   s/op
 PetclinicBenchmark.noverify                 avgt   10  5.430 ± 0.217   s/op
```

After:

```
Benchmark                           Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units
PetclinicBenchmark.devtoolsRestart  avgt   10  1.261 ± 0.188   s/op
PetclinicBenchmark.explodedJarMain  avgt   10  5.088 ± 0.207   s/op
PetclinicBenchmark.fatJar           avgt   10  5.860 ± 0.244   s/op
PetclinicBenchmark.noverify         avgt   10  5.318 ± 0.180   s/op
```

The changes are in `RepositoryConfigurationDelegate` and
`SpringDataWebConfigurationImportSelector` (where the component scan
is used in each case). The difference is perceptible, but doesn't
deliver the hoped for 800ms improvement.
